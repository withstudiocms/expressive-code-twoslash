## Acknowledgements

- [GitHub: @Hippotastic](https://github.com/hippotastic) for providing/maintaining Expressive Code as well as being a huge help during the development of this plugin!
- [EffectTS Website](https://effect.website/docs) for showing the EC Community that Twoslash CAN be used with Expressive-Code. While they did have the first working version, this re-sparked interest in me building out a fully featured EC-Twoslash plugin for the community.
- [`shiki-twoslash`](https://github.com/shikijs/twoslash/tree/main/packages/shiki-twoslash) for being the example of how to implement the elements within codeblocks as well as providing the basic layouts of the elements.
