Included in Expressive code twoslash, [Twoslash ESLint](https://twoslash.netlify.app/packages/eslint) is a Twoslash integration that added support for Twoslash to handle ESLint code blocks. Unlike other Twoslash instances, Twoslash ESLint uses `eslint` as it's meta trigger for codeblocks, and it is designed to work with JavaScript and TypeScript code blocks that contain ESLint errors. When a code block is annotated with `eslint`, Twoslash ESLint will parse the code.

This is an example taken from the Twoslash documentation website.
