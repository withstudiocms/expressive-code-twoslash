Included in Expressive code twoslash, [Twoslash ESLint](https://twoslash.netlify.app/packages/eslint) is a Twoslash integration that added support for Twoslash to handle ESLint code blocks. Unlike other Twoslash instances, Twoslash ESLint uses `eslint` as it's meta trigger for codeblocks, and it is designed to work with JavaScript and TypeScript code blocks that contain ESLint errors. When a code block is annotated with `eslint`, Twoslash ESLint will parse the code.

<Aside>
Usage of this integration requires installing the `eslint` package as a dependency in your project, as it's a peer dependency of Twoslash-ESLint. You can install it using npm, pnpm, or yarn:

```bash
npm install eslint
```

This is an example taken from the Twoslash ESLint documentation website.
